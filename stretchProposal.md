# 🌿 GreenQuest — The Eco-Social Game

---

## 🚀 Mission Statement

**GreenQuest** is a **social media experience with a gamified environmental mission**.  
Users earn points by posting **real-life eco-friendly actions**—like biking instead of driving, going zero-waste, or planting trees.

Through likes, daily and weekly challenges, and community engagement, users **level up** and build their reputation as eco-champions.  
GreenQuest turns climate-conscious living into a fun, social, and visually rewarding game — one eco-action at a time.
